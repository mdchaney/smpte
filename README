Ruby SMPTE time class

Simple Ruby class for handling SMPTE time codes and converting between
text representations and frame counts.  Useful for counting frames,
comparison, and adding or subtracting.  This handles "drop frame" format
as well as non-drop frame, so NTSC video times can be calculated and
manipulated.

I need to turn this into a gem and add a test suite, but throwing code
on github to make it public for now.  Just "require" it and you can
create objects with "SMPTE.new...".

Let me know if this is useful to you at mdchaney@michaelchaney.com.
